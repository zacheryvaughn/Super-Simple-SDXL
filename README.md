# Super Simple SDXL Text-to-Image Inference
#### This is the bare minimum script for running SDXL with the Diffusers library from Hugging Face.
#### It does not mix samplers with schedulers, it does not support LoRA's, and it does not handle mixed precision or manual precision for mps, but all of these things can easily be added if you need them.

## Step 1: Setup your project directory structure.
models/ (directory containing your models)  
outputs/ (directory where generated images will go)  
app.py (inference script for generating images)  
requirements.txt (for tracking dependencies)

## Step 2: Create a virtual environment in your root directory.
In terminal:  
python3 -m venv .venv


## Step 3: Activate your virtual environment.
In terminal:  
source myenv/bin/activate


## Step 4: Make sure pip is up to date.
In terminal:  
pip install --upgrade pip


## Step 5: Install the Hugging Face Diffusers library.
In terminal:  
pip install diffusers


## Step 6: Install the Transformers library.
In terminal:  
pip install transformers


## Step 7: Install the Transformers library.
In terminal:  
pip install torch


## Step 8: Update your requirements.txt file.
In terminal:  
pip freeze > requirements.txt


## Step 8: Write your app.py script.
Copy my script. Make sure to put your safetensors in the models directory.  
Add the model file name in the parameters section at the top.

## Step 9: Run your script.
In terminal:  
python app.py

#### Side node: 1024x1024 with Euler generates at around 2 iteration per minute on M1 Mac. You can add manual precision handling for mps in this to make it run up to 4X faster.
